Facebook's wall pages contain ATOM feeds.  These appear to work in some RSS readers, but aren't recognised by Feedburner.  There are several issues with the format of feed Facebook returns, including redirecting if the user agent is not a common browser, bad ids, nasty characters.  To fix this, I am creating this sinatra app to act as a proxy for the feed and format it so that feedburner will accept it.
